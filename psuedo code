Parts of the car
  Sensors
    Cameras
      -Sensing camera- installed in upper part of vehicle and senses a wide area in front of the vehicle, uses and image sensor to convert light entering through the lens into electrical systsme with at are processed 
                       through a system on the chip and cameras are equipped with microcomputers to issue control command to and external ECU
      -Surround view camera- installed in front, back, left, and right of the body of vehicle to sense apporximately 1 meter around the perimeter of the car, equpped with multiple image sensors and aquired data is 
                             synchronized into one omnidirectional image by another ECU
      -Drive monotoring camera- installed witin the vehicle to monitor driver's health and actions(same as sensing camera)
      -Terminology- system on chip(what is used to process the image data from sensors), MCU(relays instruction to vehicle itself such as apply break or turn wheel)
    LIDAR
      Emits laser pulses and tracks elapsed time for them pulses to reflect off the object, able to create 3D modles of suroundings, Frequency-modulated continous wave(FMCW) LIDAR uses a continous waveform that 
      gradually increases in frequency over time  creating an inferogram wich cna determine the range and velocity of object and gives detailed infomration about the enviornment
    GPS
      We'll assume an infallible GPS that has no delay and always take us to the right place
    Inertial Sensors
      Comprised of accelerometer sensors(which mease linear accleration in the x,y, and z axis and can be used to provide velocity and position), and gyroscopic sensors(measure the angular rate of x,y,z axis allowing 
      us to find the roll, pictch, and yaw of an object) this allows it to send data about the enviorment regardless of external conditions and can be used as failsafe to keep the car functionign until the other sensors
      come back online

Traffic Signs/Signals
  If a sign/signal is picked up sensing camera run image through database to find what the signal means
  If signal says stop:
    call to road markings/conditions
    when you get response start going straight
  If signal says go:
    continue going forward
  If signal has to do with the area:
    call to road layout
  If signal has to do with speed:
    call to traffic/flow of traffic 
    when you get response adjust to speed limit
  If signal has to do with zone:
    call to enviornment
  If signal is a priority sign: 
    call to other people
