Parts of the Car
  Sensors
     Cameras
       - Sensing camera – Installed in the upper part of the vehicle and senses a wide area in front of the vehicle. Uses an image sensor to convert light entering through the lens into electrical systems that are processed
         through a system on the chip. Cameras are equipped with microcomputers to issue control commands to an external ECU.
      - Surround view camera – Installed in front, back, left, and right of the body of the vehicle to sense approximately 1 meter around the perimeter of the car.
         Equipped with multiple image sensors; acquired data is synchronized into one omnidirectional image by another ECU.
      - Driver monitoring camera – Installed within the vehicle to monitor driver's health and actions (same as sensing camera).
      - Terminology
         - System on chip – Used to process the image data from sensors
         - MCU – Relays instructions to the vehicle itself, such as apply brake or turn wheel
    LIDAR
       Emits laser pulses and tracks elapsed time for the pulses to reflect off objects. Able to create 3D models of surroundings.
       Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LIDAR uses a continuous waveform that gradually increases in frequency over time,
       creating an inferogram which can determine the range and velocity of an object, and gives detailed information about the environment.
    GPS
       We'll assume an infallible GPS that has no delay and always takes us to the right place.
    Inertial Sensors
       Comprised of:
         - Accelerometer sensors – Measure linear acceleration in the x, y, and z axis and can be used to provide velocity and position
         - Gyroscopic sensors – Measure the angular rate of x, y, z axis allowing us to find the roll, pitch, and yaw of an object
      This allows it to send data about the environment regardless of external conditions and can be used as a failsafe
       to keep the car functioning until the other sensors come back online.

Traffic Signs/Signals
  If a sign/signal is picked up by sensing camera:
     - Run image through database to find what the signal means
    If signal says stop:
       - Call to road markings/conditions
    If signal says go:
       - Call to road markings/conditions
       - Continue going forward
    If signal has to do with the area:
       - Call to road layout
    If signal has to do with speed:
       - Call to traffic/flow of traffic
       - When you get response, adjust to speed limit
    If signal has to do with zone:
       - Call to road layout
    If signal is a priority sign:
       - Call to other people

Road Markings/Conditions
  If call from stop:
     - Use surround view camera to observe markings on road
     - When white lines/arrows are found, call to brakes
     - If call from go comes:
       - Continue on route
  If debris/hole on road:
     - Call to other cars
     - When response comes back, continue on route
  If lane markings:
     - Check every 30 seconds to center
     - If lane markings are not centered:
       - Call to steering
  If double white/yellow line:
     - Send to steering – do not cross
  If single white/dashed lines:
     - Send to steering – can cross

Road Layout
If call from traffic signs/signals
-If sign indicates road ahead will be dangerous -call to steering
Scan road using LIDAR every 30 seconds to get topographical structure
-if road is difficult to navigate -call to steering
 Environment
If cameras/LIDAR are impaired
-switch to Inertial sensors 
-call to steering
-LIDAR scan
