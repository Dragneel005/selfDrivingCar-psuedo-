Okay, for you here's an assignment, just pseudocode. More so to see how you'd break it down

Doesn't have to be done today, we can do it for tomorrow afternoon after our meeting.

Give me psuedocode on a self driving car with sensors/cameras that detect each general direction including the ones like northeast, southwest & objects

You want it to always drive at the speed limit, adjusting for signs in the city with some examples

It can control the vehicle but also has a safety exit feature if the person sitting in the seat selects it. We're assuming this is all in the city and not highway and has a lane departure warning system

Basically from the moment the person hits the power button to the point the car parks and says we're at the destination

We're assuming the GPS is always given a final destination

and the cameras and sensors have 0 delay and perfect readings

Every other condition is vague and completely up to your interpretation
